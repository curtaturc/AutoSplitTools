## *Common Auto Splitter Issues*
If you're having a problem with one of my auto splitters, please check some of the common issues below. If your problem is not listed, please create [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/just-ero/AutoSplitTools/issues/new/choose).
*Only load removal / game time sync is broken, everything else works*: Please make sure you are comparing against Game Time within LiveSplit.  
*The auto splitter cannot be activated from the splits editor*: Try launching LiveSplit as administrator. If the issue persists after that, it is a bug on LiveSplit's side.

## *Commission Information*
I only work for compensation (this is non-negotiable). My rates are as follows:  
* 1 hour of work: $30/hr  
* 2 hours of work: $25/hr
* 3+ hours of work: $20/hr

Prices are in USD and can be adjusted slightly depending on the situation. They are chosen so as to meet somewhat halfway with the client.  
All work will be streamed to https://twitch.tv/just-ero.
